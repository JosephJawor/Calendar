This calendar allows users to easily navigate through different months and years. The layout is clean and modern, with a default view showing the current month. You can move between months using the navigation arrows.
I used CSS Grid for a responsive design that looks good on any device. The color scheme highlights important features like the current date and selected dates.

The JavaScript functionality drives the project. It dynamically generates the calendar days based on the selected month and year, highlights the current date, and lets users select specific dates. I enjoyed tackling the challenge of ensuring it handles different month lengths and leap years correctly.

Throughout this project, I learned a lot about working with Date objects in JavaScript and manipulating the DOM for dynamic content. This has been a great opportunity for growth as a frontend developer. In the future, I would like to add features like event management, different viewing modes, and possibly backend integration for storing events. Any feedback or suggestions are much appreciated, Thank you!
